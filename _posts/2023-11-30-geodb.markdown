I just released Laravel GeoDB version 1.0.0, an opensource package to help developers handle cities, states and countries in their Laravel apps.

Read more about it [here](/projects/2023%20-%20laravel-geodb).

Package provides data for:
- 252 countries
- 50K states/regions
- 4.6M cities
- all with population, elevation, currency, and latitude/longitude information
- updatable on-demand with new data updates from GeoNames

It is available open-source on:
- GitHub: https://github.com/peergum/geodb
- Packagist: https://packagist.org/packages/peergum/geodb

Enjoy!
