So, I started the Peer-Z project in 2016, under the codename Peer-X, came back to it in 2020 for a refresh and
minor refactoring, renaming it Peer-Z. Eventually I restarted working on the
project this year, after another long pause.

The project is about developing a peer-to-peer framework that would allow
people to communicate easily beyond physical and virtual country barriers.

Peer-Z also comes with some base services:
- a mail-like app,
- a profile app,
- a local web relay,
- a storage/data-sharing app,
- a chat app,
- a checkers game,
- a chess game.

Most of the project is still in development, and hasn't yet
reached early deployment.
