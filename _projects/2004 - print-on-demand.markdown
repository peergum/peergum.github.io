Following my experience editing and publishing, I decided to investigate if it would be possible and lucrative to
manage print-on-demand in Brazil, for Brazilian authors, the same way CafePress or Lulu manage it for North American
writers. This included checking local editors and printing industry.

This eventually led to me developing a monography at ESCP for my Executive MBA.

Unfortunately, the conclusion was that the Brazilian printing industry at the time was not ready for simple online
processing of jobs, and would have required a lot of manual processing and intereactions with the editors.
