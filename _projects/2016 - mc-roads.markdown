I got my motorcycle license in 2016, and bought my first motorcycle. I started making nice rides around BC with friends,
and saw some sites that were suggesting nice rides. Unfortunately, the sites were usually build with a complex UI, not
really intuitive or convenient, so I decided to build my own site, and called it MC Roads ("Motorcycle Roads") and
bought the domain name to go with it.

The site went relatively fast to build, with the assistance of google APIs for geolocation and routing, and I used Laravel
and VueJS for the framework. That's when I realized it would be nice to have a tracker on my bike, which led me to 
jump to my next project, a Motorcycle Tracker.
