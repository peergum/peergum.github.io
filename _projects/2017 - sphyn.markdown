Sphyn was the evolution of MC Roads into the wider audience of travelers. The site was build to satisfy two goals:
- allow travelers to share their travel through maps and pictures
- allow travelers to find accommodations, similarly to [AirBnB](https://airbnb.com) or [CouchSurfing](https://couchsurfing.com)

The first part quickly expanded into sharing websites, making friends, through a dynamic interface (several dynamic
pages), and also included communities.

The second part allowed both hosts and guests to register (a guest could also be a host and share their own place), and
provided a menu of options the host could offer, all as add-on features, free or for a fee, to the discretion of the host.
The premises were displayed through a gallery of pictures.
Accommodations could be easily searched around a particular locations.
Payment was also handled, through PayPal, and a receipt was generated and emailed to the guest.
Overall, the site was offering at least the same as any professional site would, if not more, and was allowing to
sign-in or register using Facebook, Google, Apple, or through a simple email/password combination, with an email
verification in all cases. Mobile phones could also be added, to receive notifications.
