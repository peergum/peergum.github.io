After my GarageDoor project I started considering building several devices that would be interconnected through a
central device, and would control doors or lights.

Even though it was just a mere idea at that point, I started building a site to present the product to potential
buyers and see if there was any interest. I even bought a domain, triazz.com and eventually renamed the site triazz.
