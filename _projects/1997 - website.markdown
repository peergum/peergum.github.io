In 1997, I had already gotten familiarized a lot with the Internet, after 3 years working at CEGEDIM with dial-up
modem connections, and currently working at SITA/Equant, a giant worldwide telecom provider present in more than 220
countries at the time, so strong of my experience with HTML/CSS, I started building my own website on
[GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities) <b>(More)</b>

The site was relatively simple, but used some forms and CGI and was showing mostly pictures of the area (Grasse, in the South of
France) and a gallery of paintings from my then-wife. I was overall pretty happy of the design, even though to today's eyes it
would look very flat, and possibly a little too colorful and blinking.

Once I moved to Atlanta, GA, I ended buying the hilger.ph domain (Philippines, but also the 2 first letters of my
firstname...) since hilger.com was not available, and pointed the domain to that site. With GeoCities being acquired
by Yahoo!, I had to update some links and pointers, and eventually the site died with GeoCities, along with the .ph domain
which was getting too expensive...
