My house had an old garage door system, with mostly a push button that would alternately open or close the door. Even
though this was enough for common use, I wanted to be able to open the door remotely when coming back home by car or
on the motorcycle, without having to first enter the house to open the door.

Using a Particle Electron microcontroller I had recently bought through a Kickstarter project, I added some relay and
quickly developed an iPhone app that could remotely active the switch in the garage to open or close the door. After
I realized the door could close with someone inside the garage that could get hurt by the door closing, I added a WiFi
camera in the garage, and updated the iPhone app to embed the cam video remotely.
