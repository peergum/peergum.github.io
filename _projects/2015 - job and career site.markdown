While working at Lasso, I realized that LinkedIn wasn't so useful as it could be for job seekers. Something I didn't
like with LinkedIn was, most of recommendations were useless, just giving unrealistic expectations of candidates, 
thanks to their previous employer/coworkers/friends who would post excessively positive reviews of them.

I started scraping job offers from big sites like Google, Amazon, Facebook, to build a current database of jobs for 
possible candidates. Thinking about a way to make recommendations more useful, I imagined that every recommendation
should point to both positive AND negative characteristics of candidates, so recommenders would have to post as many
negative qualities as positive ones for any candidate. This way, since nobody's perfect, it would allow employers to
know better their future employees and make an informed decision, rather than a biased one.

After various conversation with co-worker, I put the idea and project on hold, due to the possibility of law suits
caused by candidates who would be dismissed by employers due to the negative recommendations.
