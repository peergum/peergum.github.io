Skloogs was my first official business as a founder. The initial intent was to start an IT consulting company,
providing system and networking related services from architecture, but I started building a website and quickly
opted to develop an e-commerce technology marketplace.

Based on Joomla and the VirtueMart plug-in, the site ended offering 8000 product references, cleanly organized by
categories and each product with their corresponding options and/or accessories. I negotiated with the main
Brazilian distributors (Ingram Micro, TechData, Officer, Mude, All Nations, Network1 & SND Distribuição), and built
some automated scraper to capture the list of products, including availability and price, and insert or update them
into the site's database. I also implemented online payments, through Moneris and PayPal, to accept credit cards from
consumers, and also adapted the shipping systems from VirtueMart to the Brazilian postal services and couriers.
