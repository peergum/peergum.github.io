Trulioo offered me my first full-time job in Vancouver, after I decided to 
shut my MusXpand venture down, in 2012. Trulioo's software manager was initially
interested in my ability
to do web scraping, in order to capture identity information on the web to
store into databases and also to be able to mimic an existing site and add
user identification features in it, for a demonstration of Trulioo Identification
APIs. <b>(More)</b>

My knowledge and experience with AWS EC2 and networking technology quickly made me the
in-house cloud specialist and devops engineer, at a time where "devops" was merely
a new concept. In the same time, I was developing the API service provided by
Trulioo to their many B2B clients, and improving the quality of the data
we had acquired by scraping sites or purchasing from external sources.
