I started at Lasso early 2014 as a Senior Development Engineer. My main task was to familiarize
with the extensive codebase of Lasso CRM, a development based on PHP, Symfony, MySQL that is used by
real estate industry to track leads for real estates companies, and connect them with building
development projects and apps.

Just after a few months working at the company, I became one of the major and faster troubleshooting developer in
the team, thanks to my analytical skills. I then progressively took on some improvement tasks, and
participated actively on the migration task force to upgrade the system APIs to Java.

I also developed and maintained excellent relationships with the sales directors, helpdesk team, and QA analysts
at the company, thanks to my motivation to always think customer first.
