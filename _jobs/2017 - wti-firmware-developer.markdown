Since 2017, I've worked full-time as a frelancer, as the only firmware engineer for
Waterloo Technical Inc, a small business in Kitchener/Waterloo, Ontario. I've collaborated with remote electrical
engineers and used my own skills in electrical engineering to define the schematics of a dozen products, then developed
the complete firmware for these devices either from scratch or taking advantage of existing libraries.

Many of these
explored technologies that I was not used to develop for, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa" target="_blank">LoRa</a>,
LTE-modems, RS-485 & <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus" target="_blank">Modbus</a>, and discover new microcontrollers,
like Particle Photon, Electron & Boron, and their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_module" target="_blank">SoM</a>,
Espressif ESP32 line with its many variations, Microchip and STMicroelectronics chips. I even had to cross-port and 
adapt between these microcontrollers for a few projects. I mostly developed using Visual Studio Code in C and C++, but occasionally
also worked on cloud aspects, including: Web applications, MySQL, Cloud Functions, Data Stores and Buckets, and their
respective management.
